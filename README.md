# Suspicious-and-Anomaly-Detection
In this project we propose a CNN architecture to detect anomaly and suspicious activities.The activities chosen for the project arerunning, jumping and kicking in public place and carrying gun, bat and knife in public places.With the trained model we compare it with the pre-existing models like Yolo, vgg16, vgg19. The trained Model is then implemented for real time detection and also used the. tflite format of the trained .h5 model to build an android classification.
